## FAQ

Q: Is the free tier sufficient?
A: It's more than enough for personal use. 10GB storage and 10GB bandwidth monthly can handle thousands of images.

Q: Do uploaded images expire?
A: No. Images remain stored as long as your Cloudflare account is active.

Q: What about slow upload speeds?
A: Upload speed primarily depends on the response time of the original image server. Use stable image sources for best results.

Q: What image formats are supported?
A: All common image formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and more.

## Important Notes

1. Ensure the image URLs you want to convert are publicly accessible
2. Regularly monitor your R2 usage to stay within the free tier limits
3. Do not upload inappropriate or illegal image content
